# Againt-with-java

This repository contains automation scripts developed for the Againt Automation project. The project focuses on building practical automation workflows using a combination of Java and JavaScript, with integrations to external services such as Google Sheets and Telegram.

The main objective of this repository is to automate report generation, data summarization, and message delivery, demonstrating clean automation logic and cross-language integration in a real-world scenario.

The repository includes a Java-based automation script used for generating and processing summary reports from Google Sheets data, as well as a JavaScript-based script responsible for sending reports or meeting summaries directly to Telegram using a bot.

Technologies used in this project include Java for core automation and data processing, JavaScript (Node.js) for messaging and integrations, Google Sheets API as the data source for reports, and Telegram Bot API for automated notifications and report delivery.

Typical use cases of this project include automated extraction and summarization of data from Google Sheets, generating structured reports programmatically, sending automated reports or meeting summaries to Telegram, and showcasing an end-to-end automation workflow that combines Java and JavaScript.

To run the Java automation, Java JDK 8 or higher is required. After configuring access to Google Sheets if needed, the Java file can be compiled and executed using standard javac and java commands. For the Telegram automation, Node.js must be installed and a valid Telegram Bot Token should be configured in the script before running it with Node.js.

This repository is intended for educational, demonstration, and portfolio purposes, and may be extended in the future with dependency management, improved error handling, logging, testing, and CI/CD integration.
